# Yelp Import Tool

The purpose of this script is to load restaurant data into a MongoDB Atlas database using the Yelp Fusion API.

Getting Started:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster
1. [Sign up on Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/signup) to get access to [Yelp's developer site](https://www.yelp.com/developers) and generate a Yelp OAuth authorization token.
1. Edit the [config.js](./config.js) file and set the values for the following parameters:
    * `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string. Make sure the `<DATABASE>` placeholder is set to `platespace` and the MongoDB user you use has permissions to write into the `platespace` database.
    * `YELP_AUTH_TOKEN`: add the OAuth2 bearer token generated from [https://api.yelp.com/oauth2/token](https://api.yelp.com/oauth2/token) using the Client ID and Client Secret values from your [Yelp App](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app). More information is available in the [Yelp Developer site](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication). You could use the following CURL command to generate your Yelp token:

        `curl -X POST https://api.yelp.com/oauth2/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&client_secret=[YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]'`

    Another option is to use a GUI tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com). The screenshot below shows how to generate such a token using Postman and your Yelp app's Client ID and Secret.

    ![Generating a Yelp OAuth token with Postman](https://github.com/mongodb/stitch-examples/blob/master/PlateSpace/ETL/res/YelpOAuthToken_Postman.jpg?raw=true)
    * `BASE_LOCATION_LATITUDE`: Enter the latitude of the base location that Yelp uses to retrieve the nearest 1,000 restaurants. Use negative decimals for South latitudes. Set by default to the latitude of San Francisco, California.
    * `BASE_LOCATION_LONGITUDE`: Enter the longitude of the base location that Yelp uses to retrieve the nearest 1,000 restaurants. Use negative decimals for West longitudes. Set by default to the longitude of San Francisco, California.
1. From a Terminal (MacOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Microsoft Windows) window running from the __ETL__ folder, run `npm install` to install the required Node.js packages.
1. Run `node index.js` to import restaurant data from Yelp into the `restaurants` collection of your `platespace` database.

The restaurants collection schema is the following:

```javascript
    {
      name: String,
      address: String,
      phone: String,
      image_url: String,
      website: String,
      attributes: Object,
      location: Object,
      openingHours: Object,
      averageRating: Number,
      numberOfRates: Number
    }
```

Please note that the `attributes` and `openingHours` fields are not retrieved from Yelp but are sample values generated by the import script.
